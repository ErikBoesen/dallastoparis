                <h3>Mobility Justice</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column paris">
                <h4>Paris</h4>
                <p>Paris overall is seen as a more cohesive city in terms of income differences, although not perfect. The citizens of Paris care very much about their social justice as seen in protests like the Yellow Vest movement, the protest against high unemployment and an economy that has stagnated. France as a whole has more community and considerate-based beliefs about income, understanding that for someone to be earning more money, another person must be making less. This has resulted in a more smooth distribution of income and a more homogenous sense of socioeconomic status throughout the city.</p>
                <p>This is measurable by the ratio between the highest and the lowest IRIS area (area smaller than municipalities and neighborhoods for greater accuracy). This ratio is only 7x in difference in terms of median income. This may sound like a lot but it is certainly not extreme, and undeniably there are poorer neighborhoods because that’s essentially inevitable, but the transition is cohesive.</p>
                <p>The overall income distribution in Paris comprises of higher median incomes and more “wealthy” people living in central and western Paris, whereas lower incomes tend to live in northern Paris, and around the outskirts (Figure 1). This dispersion and segregation is referred to as the “Redbelt” of a wealthy growing core, surrounded by poorer and stagnant suburbs. Over time, the top income areas in western and central Paris have increased significantly from 1999-2015, as well as spread to more eastern areas like Seine et Marne and the southern department of Essonne, thus resulting in the gentrification of these traditionally poorer neighborhoods (Figure 2).</p>
                <p>Fun fact, the highest medium income in Paris can be found near the Eiffel Tower! This is most likely because of the premium of living next to the breathtaking views of one of the world's most renowned architectural pieces.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I found it quite interesting how Paris's population distribution correlates with its income distribution. We see in Figure 3 that a majority of Paris's population lives primarily on the outskirts and northwestern districts, which line up perfectly with the map of where lower-income residents live. This relationship explains that not only is a majority of Paris's population not overly wealthy, but that reliable public transportation is crucial. This is because it is typically citizens who are far from the centers of their cities and who suffer from financial hardship and have low incomes (cannot afford cars and gasoline), that rely most on public transportation. Hence describing Paris's precise population demographic.</p>

                <h4>Dallas</h4>
                <p>America as a whole has a different perception of wealth revolving around “more is better”. The concept of the American Dream encourages one to “make it big” and aim to be a CEO or company founder. This creates jobs and advances the economy forward therefore it is deemed desirable and beneficial.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Paris, Dallas's socioeconomic disparities largely intersect with race, and we see a much more rapid transition from poor to wealthy with smaller areas of land and a less smooth transition. This is because people of color in Dallas have suffered from centuries-old segregation and racism, which prevents them from taking advantage of the city's strong economy.</p>
                <p>There are more than 1.2 million people living in Dallas, including 530,277 Latinos, 373,197 White people, 310,099 Black people, and 41,273 Asian people. Since Dallas's population demographic comprises of more minorities than White citizens, it sheds light on the economic differences between its various ethnic communities and the challenges minorities face.</p>
                <p>For instance, 61.3% of Black households and 65.8% of Latino households in Dallas are affected by liquid asset poverty, which affects over half of the Black and Latino population. Liquid asset poverty affects just 22.9% of White households and 32.7% of Asian households. If that’s not enough indicator of the disparities, Whites in Dallas have a median income of $73,091, while Black households in Dallas earn a median income of $30,985.</p>
                <p>Property value is also a big indicator of the socioeconomic status of the communities citizens are living in. The median property values for White and Asian homeowners are $295,000 and $245,000, respectively, while the median property value for Latino residents is $90,000 and for Black residents is $85,000. Additionally, this just applies to minorities who own a home as many do not. Black residents have a homeownership rate of 28.5%, while 33.6% of Asian residents and 41.4% of Latino residents are homeowners compared to 53.2% of White residents are homeowners in Dallas. White households make up 95% of upper-middle-class homes, yet they only make up roughly 50% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>
                <p>Overall, race, income, and neighborhoods within Dallas all correlate. The neighborhoods with the highest income in Figure 2, also very clearly overlap with the White and Asian residents in Figure 1. The neighborhoods with the lowest income in Figure 2, also explicitly overlap with the Black and Hispanic residents in Figure 1. This correlation creates marginalized communities which has been caused by history but is further perpetuated by ignorance. Adequate public transportation can help support marginalized communities and break this harmful cycle by providing more mobility. This can allow access to more economic and job opportunities, and education, as well as promote social inclusion.</p>

                <h3>Quality of Transit</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column paris">
                <h4>Paris</h4>
                <p>The public transport system in Paris is renowned for its efficiency. The Métro runs consistently throughout the day, with an average frequency of two to three minutes at peak hours. According to The Tour Guy, commuter satisfaction is increased overall because of this high frequency, which reduces wait times and makes transportation within the city easier.  In contrast, light rail services on Dallas's DART take longer to arrive; during rush hour, they run every 7½–15 minutes, and during off-peak hours, they run every 20–30 minutes. Particularly for individuals with strict schedules, these longer intervals may cause commuter dissatisfaction and decrease their use of the transit system.</p>
                <p>Paris's transit system enjoys an extremely positive public view, which is attributed to its massive network, cultural appeal of its stops, and reliability. The system's reputation as one of the best in the world for transportation is furthered by its capacity to handle high passenger volumes on a daily basis.
However, popular opinion of Dallas's public transportation is problematic. Even though it's one of the biggest systems in the country, it frequently receives criticism for being complex and inefficient. The perception is further impacted by the city's historically car-centric development, which has shaped citizens' preference for private automobiles over public transportation and their reliance on them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column dallas">
                <h4>Dallas</h4>
                <p>The way that public transportation networks are designed affects how the general population feels and uses them. The art nouveau entrances and historically themed stations of Paris's Métro seamlessly incorporate cultural history into ordinary travel experiences. A unique concept that improves the commuter experience and represents Paris's architectural past may be found in stations like Arts et Métiers, which have copper walls and portholes.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Dallas's DART stations prioritize utility over cultural integration due to their contemporary and practical design. The DART Art Program, which aims to enhance rider experiences and beautify transportation facilities, is reflected in the station's art installations, which are clean and contemporary in design. But unlike in Paris, these initiatives don't fully penetrate the city's historical or cultural narratives.</p>

                <h3>Investment in Transit</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column paris">
                <h4>Paris</h4>
                <p>Paris has made significant investments in public transportation, with a focus on both extending contemporary transit options and preserving its ancient infrastructure. The city has started working on large-scale projects like the Grand Paris Express, which entails extending the current Métro lines and building four new ones. The European Investment Bank estimates that this project will cost more than €35 billion and will improve connection throughout the Paris metropolitan area, especially in underdeveloped suburbs.</p>
                <p>Paris also makes investments in environmentally friendly transportation options, such as enlarging its bike lanes and the Vélib bike-sharing scheme. These programs are a part of a larger effort called ITDP Transport, which aims to encourage environmentally friendly transportation options and lessen reliance on cars.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column dallas">
                <h4>Dallas</h4>
                <p>Dallas has prioritized the modernization and expansion of its bus and light rail systems when it comes to transportation spending. The city's plan for a better connected and effective transit system is laid out in the Connect Dallas Strategic Mobility Plan. In order to address major issues including connectivity and accessibility, this strategy gives strategic investments top priority in order to increase service frequency, broaden coverage, and improve user experience.</p>
                <p>However, Dallas will have a difficult time getting the public to accept and pay large-scale transit initiatives. The ongoing efforts of the city to transition from a car-centric development paradigm to one that is more transit-oriented are in need of consistent investment and legislative support in order to achieve a thorough transformation similar to what is observed in Paris.</p>
                <p>These comparisons highlight the different strategies and results that urban transportation development in Paris and Dallas has to offer. While Dallas continues to work to enhance its transportation system within a historically car-centric society, Paris, with its concentration on blending cultural history and modern efficiency in transit, along with significant financial investment, stands in stark contrast.</p>

                <h3>Transportation Policies</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column paris">
                <h4>Paris</h4>
                <p>1. Tarification Intégrée (Unified Fare System): Paris makes it easy for commuters with a unified fare system managed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This means you can hop on any mode of public transportation in the region with just one ticket or pass, making travel convenient and affordable.</p>
                <p>2. Grand Paris Express (Metro Expansion): Paris continually invests in expanding its metro system to accommodate its growing population. By adding new lines and extending existing ones, the city aims to offer widespread coverage and reduce the reliance on cars for commuting.</p>
                <p>3. Plan Vélo (Pedestrian and Cyclist Priority): Paris prioritizes pedestrians and cyclists by creating car-free zones, expanding bike lanes, and offering bike-sharing programs like Vélib'. These efforts promote eco-friendly transportation options and help ease traffic congestion.</p>
                <p>4. Politique de Développement Urbain Durable (Transit-Oriented Development): Paris encourages Transit-Oriented Development around metro and RER stations, fostering communities where residents can easily access public transportation, amenities, and workplaces without relying on cars.</p>
                <p>5. Plan Climat de Paris (Environmental Sustainability): Paris takes steps to tackle air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by incentivizing electric vehicles, restricting high-polluting vehicles, and promoting walking, cycling, and the use of public transit.</p>

            <div class="column dallas">
                <h4>Dallas</h4>
                <p>1. DART Expansion Plans: Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) has ambitious plans to expand its coverage and enhance connectivity across the metropolitan area. However, progress has been hindered by funding limitations and political obstacles.</p>
                <p>2. Subsidized Parking Requirements: Dallas historically leans toward car-centric development, reflected in policies mandating minimum parking requirements for new constructions. This approach fosters urban sprawl, increases car dependency, and undermines public transit competitiveness.</p>
                <p>3. Transit Operations Funding Challenges: Dallas struggles to secure adequate funding for transit operations, leading to service cuts, decreased frequency, and reliability issues. This funding gap dissuades potential riders and affects the overall quality of public transportation.</p>
                <p>4. Suburbanization and Sprawl: Dallas's urban planning tends to prioritize suburban expansion over densification and transit-oriented development. Consequently, the city experiences sprawling development, longer commutes, and heightened car reliance.</p>
                <p>5. Accessibility and Walkability Concerns: Dallas may lack the pedestrian-friendly infrastructure seen in cities like Paris due to policies favoring road expansion and car convenience. This oversight impacts the availability of sidewalks, crosswalks, and improvements to public transportation accessibility.</p>
                <p>These examples highlight the differing strategies of Paris and Dallas in shaping their public transportation systems and urban landscapes. While Paris focuses on building sustainable, accessible transit networks, Dallas grapples with overcoming car-centric planning and reaching a consensus on transportation priorities. The differing priorities held by each city reflects on the the quality and usage of public transportation.</p>

            <h4>Imagining an improved Dallas transit system</h4>
            <p>Based on public opinion on public transportation in Paris, the consensus seemed to be that the most convenient and preferred method of transportation was through the Metro system since it connected hotspots of the city and was a fast mode of transportation. Seeing that Dallas has an established railroad system, Dallas-Fort Worth Rail System (DART) , we sought to see how this system could be improved in terms of efficiency and usage. It is important to note that unlike Paris, Dallas does not have a subway system that would of course make transportation through public transit be more efficient. Focusing on the DART we compared it to the metro system of Paris. We noted that one of the strengths of public transportation in Paris was its interconnectedness with each other. You could get virtually anywhere with minimal hassle because of how many different routes you could take due to the overlaps in transportation lines. This was a key feature missing in the DART. The DART at the core is similar to the metro in Paris, with a central grand station where all lines converge and then diverge into respective regions but there is not much overlap with the lines, just straight destinations.</p>
            <p>Our goal was to recreate the DART by adding and expanding lines to the current system to make transportation more efficient without needing to go to the central hub to transfer. We overlaid a commute time map over our map of the DART and created lines that would not only make transfers easier but also encourage public transportation usage based on how traffic heavy each region was. Public transportation in these areas would not only reduce the commute time for drivers but also reduce the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.</p>
            <p>In our proposal, we created 4 new lines: Yellow, Pink, Purple, and Lime, as well as extended some of the existing lines to cover a larger serviced area based on where people were commuting the most. The darker the red, the more commute time for the given area so we wanted to focus on accessibility and convenience of public transportation in those areas. The Pink line focused on reaching hotspot areas that were not covered by the original 4 lines. The Yellow and Lime lines focused on connecting the outer boundaries of each of the four branching lines from the central station allowing for easy transfers without having to go all the way to the grand central space. Similarly the Purple line is a full circle loop line that connects all the lines. From our observations having a loop line that connects all the lines rather than having all of them converge onto one grand station helps with travel times and convenience but also reduces the congestion at the central station. This is a method used by Paris and other cities with great public transportation such as Seoul to improve efficiency of their transportation.</p>
            <p>Although this proposal mainly focuses on convenience and reaching city hotspots, we believe that by creating these stops and interconnections are necessary for encouraging the public to use public transportation. With more investment into public transportation in Dallas, expansions like this would be possible and would lead to a larger volume of people opting to take public transportation than commuting by car.</p>
