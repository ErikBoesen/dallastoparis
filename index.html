                <h3>Quality of Transit</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column paris">
                <h4>Paris</h4>
                <p>The public transport system in Paris is renowned for its efficiency. The Métro runs consistently throughout the day, with an average frequency of two to three minutes at peak hours. According to The Tour Guy, commuter satisfaction is increased overall because of this high frequency, which reduces wait times and makes transportation within the city easier.  In contrast, light rail services on Dallas's DART take longer to arrive; during rush hour, they run every 7½–15 minutes, and during off-peak hours, they run every 20–30 minutes. Particularly for individuals with strict schedules, these longer intervals may cause commuter dissatisfaction and decrease their use of the transit system.</p>
                <p>Paris's transit system enjoys an extremely positive public view, which is attributed to its massive network, cultural appeal of its stops, and reliability. The system's reputation as one of the best in the world for transportation is furthered by its capacity to handle high passenger volumes on a daily basis.
However, popular opinion of Dallas's public transportation is problematic. Even though it's one of the biggest systems in the country, it frequently receives criticism for being complex and inefficient. The perception is further impacted by the city's historically car-centric development, which has shaped citizens' preference for private automobiles over public transportation and their reliance on them.</p>

            <div class="column dallas">
                <h4>Dallas</h4>
                <p>The way that public transportation networks are designed affects how the general population feels and uses them. The art nouveau entrances and historically themed stations of Paris's Métro seamlessly incorporate cultural history into ordinary travel experiences. A unique concept that improves the commuter experience and represents Paris's architectural past may be found in stations like Arts et Métiers, which have copper walls and portholes.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Dallas's DART stations prioritize utility over cultural integration due to their contemporary and practical design. The DART Art Program, which aims to enhance rider experiences and beautify transportation facilities, is reflected in the station's art installations, which are clean and contemporary in design. But unlike in Paris, these initiatives don't fully penetrate the city's historical or cultural narratives.</p>

                <h3>Investment in Transit</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column paris">
                <h4>Paris</h4>
                <p>Paris has made significant investments in public transportation, with a focus on both extending contemporary transit options and preserving its ancient infrastructure. The city has started working on large-scale projects like the Grand Paris Express, which entails extending the current Métro lines and building four new ones. The European Investment Bank estimates that this project will cost more than €35 billion and will improve connection throughout the Paris metropolitan area, especially in underdeveloped suburbs.</p>
                <p>Paris also makes investments in environmentally friendly transportation options, such as enlarging its bike lanes and the Vélib bike-sharing scheme. These programs are a part of a larger effort called ITDP Transport, which aims to encourage environmentally friendly transportation options and lessen reliance on cars.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column dallas">
                <h4>Dallas</h4>
                <p>Dallas has prioritized the modernization and expansion of its bus and light rail systems when it comes to transportation spending. The city's plan for a better connected and effective transit system is laid out in the Connect Dallas Strategic Mobility Plan. In order to address major issues including connectivity and accessibility, this strategy gives strategic investments top priority in order to increase service frequency, broaden coverage, and improve user experience.</p>
                <p>However, Dallas will have a difficult time getting the public to accept and pay large-scale transit initiatives. The ongoing efforts of the city to transition from a car-centric development paradigm to one that is more transit-oriented are in need of consistent investment and legislative support in order to achieve a thorough transformation similar to what is observed in Paris.</p>
                <p>These comparisons highlight the different strategies and results that urban transportation development in Paris and Dallas has to offer. While Dallas continues to work to enhance its transportation system within a historically car-centric society, Paris, with its concentration on blending cultural history and modern efficiency in transit, along with significant financial investment, stands in stark contrast.</p>

                <h3>Transportation Policies</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column paris">
                <h4>Paris</h4>
                <p>1. Tarification Intégrée (Unified Fare System): Paris makes it easy for commuters with a unified fare system managed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This means you can hop on any mode of public transportation in the region with just one ticket or pass, making travel convenient and affordable.</p>
                <p>2. Grand Paris Express (Metro Expansion): Paris continually invests in expanding its metro system to accommodate its growing population. By adding new lines and extending existing ones, the city aims to offer widespread coverage and reduce the reliance on cars for commuting.</p>
                <p>3. Plan Vélo (Pedestrian and Cyclist Priority): Paris prioritizes pedestrians and cyclists by creating car-free zones, expanding bike lanes, and offering bike-sharing programs like Vélib'. These efforts promote eco-friendly transportation options and help ease traffic congestion.</p>
                <p>4. Politique de Développement Urbain Durable (Transit-Oriented Development): Paris encourages Transit-Oriented Development around metro and RER stations, fostering communities where residents can easily access public transportation, amenities, and workplaces without relying on cars.</p>
                <p>5. Plan Climat de Paris (Environmental Sustainability): Paris takes steps to tackle air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by incentivizing electric vehicles, restricting high-polluting vehicles, and promoting walking, cycling, and the use of public transit.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="column dallas">
                <h4>Dallas</h4>
                <p>1. DART Expansion Plans: Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) has ambitious plans to expand its coverage and enhance connectivity across the metropolitan area. However, progress has been hindered by funding limitations and political obstacles.</p>
                <p>2. Subsidized Parking Requirements: Dallas historically leans toward car-centric development, reflected in policies mandating minimum parking requirements for new constructions. This approach fosters urban sprawl, increases car dependency, and undermines public transit competitiveness.</p>
                <p>3. Transit Operations Funding Challenges: Dallas struggles to secure adequate funding for transit operations, leading to service cuts, decreased frequency, and reliability issues. This funding gap dissuades potential riders and affects the overall quality of public transportation.</p>
                <p>4. Suburbanization and Sprawl: Dallas's urban planning tends to prioritize suburban expansion over densification and transit-oriented development. Consequently, the city experiences sprawling development, longer commutes, and heightened car reliance.</p>
                <p>5. Accessibility and Walkability Concerns: Dallas may lack the pedestrian-friendly infrastructure seen in cities like Paris due to policies favoring road expansion and car convenience. This oversight impacts the availability of sidewalks, crosswalks, and improvements to public transportation accessibility.</p>
                <p>These examples highlight the differing strategies of Paris and Dallas in shaping their public transportation systems and urban landscapes. While Paris focuses on building sustainable, accessible transit networks, Dallas grapples with overcoming car-centric planning and reaching a consensus on transportation priorities. The differing priorities held by each city reflects on the the quality and usage of public transportation.</p>
